The Shakespearean Insult Constructor
====================================
Constructs an insult based on three components, the final string preceded by "Thou"
Based on and uses content from the Shakespearean Insult Kit at: http://web.mit.edu/dryfoo/Funny-pages/shakespeare-insult-kit.html

What it needs
=============
This game requires Python 2.7 on your system. Most Linux distributions include this out of the box, but if not, you can install it from your package manage if your distro has one. Windows and Mac OSX users will need to download it from python.org/download and install it on your system. Be sure to pick the right download for your operating system and processor architecture and remember, version 2.7, not 3.

How to run
==========

Extract the contents of this ZIP file somewhere you can easily find it, for example, your home folder (if using Linux) or your C:\ drive (if using Windows). Make sure to extract ALL files when you do so. It's so easy to get caught out by your ZIP program and wind up extracting only the selected file. Done that? Great.

Open a command prompt (Windows) or terminal window (Linux/Mac OSX) and navigate to the correct folder using "dir" (Windows) or "cd" (Linux/Mac). Once there, type "python insult_constructor.py" for the CLI-based version or "python insult_constructor_ui.py" for the GUI version and it should run. Otherwise, I don't know what to say.

How to use
==========
In the CLI version: Just run the program and it'll immediately construct an insult. You're then asked if you wish to quit. Type "y" to quit or "n" to get a new insult.

In the GUI version: Click the button labelled "Construct thy insult". A new insult will be constructed and displayed, and another button, labelled "Copy to thy clipboard" will be enabled. This button does exactly what it says on the tin: copies the current insult to the clipboard.

NOTE: If running in Linux, be sure to paste your insult BEFORE closing the program. When you close the program, the clipboard jettisons the copied insult for some reason. In Windows, though, the insult stays in the clipboard, even after closing the program.
